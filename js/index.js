{quote: "If we think that there is no education without students, then there is no education situation without certain objects to be known, to be taught, to be learned. I prefer to say to be known and reknown.", name:"Paolo Freire"},
{quote: "These two risks exist: the risk of putting in parenthesis the content and to emphasize exclusively the political problem and the risk of putting parenthesis the political dimension of the content and to teach just the content. For me both attitudes are wrong. And it is a question that comes up because of the nature of the process of education or the process of politics.", name:"Paolo Freire"},

{quote: "We were dealing with the radicals, but we were dealing also with the people that they couldn't reach. They had to reach the people through us quite often. Their speeches didn't get to them. And when they did, the people didn't know what to do with the speeches.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "They assumed that we were an organizer's training school. But I kept saying no, no. We do education and they become organized.", name:"Myles Horton"},

{quote: "I think certainly you can learning from mobilizing, but you can learn to manipulate the people or you can learn to educate the people.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "Organizers who hope to educate must increase their historical and cultural sensitivity.", name:"Paolo Freire"},
{quote: "We had been successful at Highlander earlier in organizing a county in which we lived, organizing the unions, and organizing the county politically. We took over the county politically by using education.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "Within that framework I was interested in going as far as I could in helping people develop the capacity to make decisions and to take responsibility, which is what I think is the role of educator.", name:"Myles Horton"},

{quote: "I've never yet found any experts that know where the line is. If people who want to be experts want to tell people what to do because they think it's their duty to tell them what to do, to me that takes away the power of people to make decisions.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "How is it possible for us to work in a community without feeling the spirit of the culture that has been there for many years, without trying to understand the soul of the culture? We cannot interfere in this culture. Without understanding the soul of the culture we just invade the culture.", name:"Paolo Freire"},
{quote: "It is cultural and historical, and if it is cultural and historical, it can be changed. And if it can be changed, it's not unethical to put the possibility of change on the table.", name:"Paolo Freire"},
{quote: "I have no respect for people who claim to be neutral making criticisms of us--none. They have the power base to magnify all of their positions, and then they label it neutral;.", name:"Myles Horton"},

{quote: "I'm not saying everything in a people's culture is bad. I'm just saying that you have to pick and choose and keep the good things. Now I have very little respect for the electoral system in the United States.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "We've stretched it to try to make it work for different kind of problems and in stretching and adapting, we lost its meaning. We still have the form but not the meaning.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "The educator does not have the right to be silent just because he or she has to respect the culture. If he or she does not have the right to impose his or her voice on the people, he does not have the right to be silent. It has to do precisely with the duty of intervening, which the educator has to assume without becoming afraid. There is no reason for an educator to be ashamed of this.", name:"Paolo Freire"},
{quote: "Every time it was possible for children, without risking their lives, to learn by doing, I preferred that they do this.", name:"Paolo Freire"},
{quote: "Without the limits, it's impossible for freedom to become freedom and also it's impossible for authority to accomplish its duty, which is precisely to structure limits.", name:"Paolo Freire"},
{quote: "If you use that idea of limits, you've got to also think of how people accept limits that don't even exist--like in the university... Most of them could get by, could do much more than they realize they can do... Most people will find out they can go much further in an institution that is big and bureaucratic and depends primarily on reports and grades.", name:"Myles Horton"},

{quote: "they come absolutely convinced that the teacher has to give a class to them", name:"Paulo Freire"},

{quote: "It takes the power of everyone united to get a grievance settled.", name:"Myles Horton"},

{quote: "Highlander can't be described as an organization because it isn't departmen­talized and mechanistically conceived. It's more of an organism, therefore it's hard to describe. It's a mosaic or a piece of weaving.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "Highlander is a kind of a weaving of many colors, some blend and some clash, but you know it's alive.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "Movements change what goes on and how things are organized.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "We were part of the world but we had to start locally.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "Authority is necessary to the educational process as well as necessary to the freedom of the stu­dents and my own. The teacher is absolutely necessary. What is bad, what is not necessary, is authoritarianism, but not authority.", name:"Paulo Freire"},
{quote: "The teacher is of course an artist, but being an artist does not mean that he or she can make the profile, can shape the students. What the educator does in teaching is to make it possible for the students to be­come themselves.", name:"Paulo Freire"},

{quote: "I'm just saying that we understand that the people who claim to be neutral, and call us propagandists because we are not neutral, are not neutral either. They're just ignorant.

{quote: "I try to find ways to expose them to learning processes that would finally lead them to take a look at my conclusion.", name:"Myles Horton"},
{quote: "MYLES: Well I think you have to divide that into principles. When I say what I believe, I'm talking about prin­ciples such as love and democracy, where people control their Jives.
